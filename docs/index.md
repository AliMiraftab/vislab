VisLab is a set of modules for visual recognition:

- Preparing a dataset.
- Computing features on images.
- Splitting the dataset into train/val/test, and training/testing a predictor.
- Evaluating prediction results, outputting figures and tables.
- Displaying dataset and prediction results in a web interface.

The best place to get started is the [tutorial](/tutorial.html).

This code was written partially during an internship at Adobe Creative Technologies Lab in 2013.
