# Vislab

## Overview

Vislab is a set of modules for visual recognition:

- Preparing a dataset.
- Computing features on images.
- Splitting the dataset into train/val/test, and training/testing a predictor.
- Evaluating prediction results, outputting figures and tables.
- Displaying dataset and prediction results in a web interface.

It is released under the BSD 2-clause [license]({{site.repo}}/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
